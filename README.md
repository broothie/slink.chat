# [Slink](http://www.slink.chat/) - an [AIM](https://www.aim.com/) clone visually influenced by [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95)

[Slink](http://www.slink.chat/) started as a simple attempt at cloning the much-beloved team collaboration tool [Slack](https://slack.com/), and quickly became an amalgamation of Slack and primordial AOL Instant Messenger.

It was [originally written in Rails](https://github.com/broothie/slink) and hosted on Heroku as my capstone project for [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/).
This repo is a rewrite in Go, hosted on GCP.
